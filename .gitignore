# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, I Tthink that makes sense only for applications, not libraries:
#   https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/advanced/#pipfile-vs-setuptools
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
